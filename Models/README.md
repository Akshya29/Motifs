Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) were inferred using GENIE3, TIGRESS, ARACNe, and CLR, and the resulting network predictions were incorporated as feature columns. In addition, biological datasets capturing chromatin accessibility and regulatory potential were integrated, including Accessible Chromatin Regions (ACRs) (Zheng et al., 2025) and Unmethylated Regions (UMRs) (Crisp et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). These regions represent potential transcription factor (TF) binding sites, with UMRs frequently overlapping promoters and enhancers. To identify possible TF regulators, FIMO was applied to promoter sequences, ACRs, and UMRs, yielding an experimentally supported GRN. Furthermore, DAP-seq peak data were incorporated from Yuan et al. (2024) to provide additional TF–DNA interaction evidence.

Three models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and an Ensemble model (made from taking the average of both the models) were built using these GRNs as features to predict the best/accurate GRNs.
