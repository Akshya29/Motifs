This page explains how the integration of different tools can help predict a more accurate GRN, particularly in version 5 of maize (*Zea mays*).

Recently, many machine learning–based models have been developed to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which represent how genes regulate each other. While these approaches can provide valuable biological insights, they often yield different predictions when applied to the same dataset, making it difficult to confidently identify regulatory interactions. Additionally, experimental noise and the inherent complexity of gene regulation — which can be nonlinear, context-dependent, and include feedback loops — further challenge accurate modeling. To overcome these issues, integrating predictions from multiple methods has been shown to improve overall accuracy compared to relying on a single approach. This strategy, which combines different algorithms to generate consensus networks, leverages the unique strengths of each method, resulting in more robust and biologically meaningful GRNs.

The tools focused here are TIGRESS (a logistic Machine learning model), bioNeRO (a package that can run 3 tools, namely Genie3, ARACNe, and CLR together), and FIMO (a tool to find the motif occurrence in a gene).
